# React Compound Components

A scalable and reusable React web app built with Vite and styled using vanilla CSS. This project demonstrates advanced React patterns such as compound components, Context API with custom hooks, render props, and performance optimizations like debouncing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Compound Components Pattern**  
  Enables flexible and scalable UI design by allowing components to work together under a shared state and context.

- **Context API + Custom Hooks**  
  Centralized and clean state management for shared logic across components.

- **Render Props Pattern**  
  Uses `children` and `key` props as functions to enhance reusability and dynamic rendering.

- **Search with Debouncing**  
  Improves performance by limiting the rate of search executions during input.
